# 🔐 AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) – Notes

IAM is a global AWS service used to securely control access to AWS resources.

---

# 📌 What is IAM?

IAM allows you to:
- Manage users and their access
- Control permissions
- Secure AWS resources
- Implement least privilege principle

IAM is global (not region-specific).

---

# 🧱 Core IAM Components

## 1️⃣ Users
- Represents a person or application
- Can have:
  - Console password
  - Access keys (CLI / SDK)

⚠️ Avoid using root user for daily tasks.

---

## 2️⃣ Groups
- Collection of users
- Permissions attached to group
- Users inherit permissions

Note:
- A user can belong to multiple groups
- Groups cannot contain other groups

---

## 3️⃣ Roles (Very Important for SAA)

- Used for temporary access
- No long-term credentials
- Assumed by:
  - EC2
  - Lambda
  - Cross-account users
  - Federation

Example:
EC2 → Assume Role → Access S3 securely

---

## 4️⃣ Policies

JSON document defining permissions.

### Types:
- AWS Managed Policy
- Customer Managed Policy
- Inline Policy
